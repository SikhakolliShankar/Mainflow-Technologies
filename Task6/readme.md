## About The Project

Hyderabad Tourist Spots Gallery is a React-based web application that allows users to explore and appreciate the beautiful tourist spots in Hyderabad, India. Each spot is showcased with high-quality images in a grid layout, and users can click on any image to open a modal view for a closer look. The modal provides navigation buttons to easily scroll through the gallery without leaving the modal.
